# MIR Project

**Course:** [LTAT.02.015] Music Information Retrieval 2023/24, UT

**Topic idea**: Vocal track extraction / instrument separation toolset

**Goal:** Create a simple to use(!) program for extracting specific instruments from a song (using Mel features, probably) and cleaning them up to sound passable. Must support common pop/rock instruments, such as vocals, guitars, drums (at least partly), and bass. Potentially allow mixing and matching various songs and instruments.


**Team:** Anton Slavin, Ines Anett Nigol
