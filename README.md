# MIR Project

**Course:** [LTAT.02.015] Music Information Retrieval 2023/24, UT

**Topic idea 1**: Vocal track extraction / instrument separation toolset

**Goal:** Create a simple to use(!) program for extracting specific instruments from a song (using Mel features, probably) and cleaning them up to sound passable. Must support common pop/rock instruments, such as vocals, guitars, drums (at least partly), and bass. Potentially allow mixing and matching various songs and instruments.

**Topic idea 2**: An implementation of the [Audio Mosaicing](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/2015-ISMIR-LetItBee) technique using NMF-like algorithms

**Goal:** Create a program for transferring one "style" of a song to another -- dubbed mosaicing. E.g. melody and rhythm of "Let It Be" with the timbre of a swarm of bees buzzing. 

**Team:** Anton Slavin
